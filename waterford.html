          <p>
            This website was made for the Research team at Waterford.org. Prior
            to this, the nonprofit organization had a general website
            encompassing all parts of their purpose. However, there was not much
            focus on the Research portion of their organization. Thus, this
            website was set into motion!
          </p>
          <p>The client had the following goals:</p>
          <ul class="design-list">
            <li>create a modern, visually appealing site</li>
            <li>
              promote organization's software by showcasing its content in
              engaging ways
            </li>
            <li>
              emphasize strong focus on research (imrpoving efficacy and stands
              out against competition)
            </li>
            <li>
              encourage people to provide funding for organization to meet its
              program goals
            </li>
            <li>
              make research more presentable and relevant with PDF previews and
              summaries
            </li>
          </ul>

              I conducted user interviews to answer the following question:
              <em
                >How can Waterford present their research on a website
                effectively for users?</em
              >
              or in other words, what are their <em>goals</em>?

          </div>
          <div>
            <p>The results revealed the following user goals:</p>
            <ul class="design-list">

              <li>comprehend the research process</li>

            <h3>Website Draft</h3>
            <p>
              This is when I finally wrote the code with working functionality.
              I also altered some designs as I went to create a more cohesive
              looking project.
            </p>
            <p>Here's an example of a change that I made:</p>
            <div class="two-versions">
              <div>
                <img src="images/version1.png" alt="" />
                <p>version 1</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <img src="images/version2.png" alt="" />
                <p>version 2</p>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>

            <h3>Usability Tests</h3>
            <p>
              I gave tasks for a user to complete and observed their behavior.
              Results revealed a few parts that needed to be adjusted. Notes of
              testing adhered to the following format:
            </p>
            <img
              src="images/usability-testing.png"
              alt="Usability Testing Table"
              class="code"
            />
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Reflect and Revise</h3>
            <p>
              Usability testing revealed an issue with the quotations on the
              Family Engagement page.
            </p>
            <p>
              Initially, on the Family Engagement page, there was a sidebar of
              quotations. However, it seemed too cluttered and was not very
              usable. Thus, I created a carousel of quotes to put at the bottom
              of the page.
            </p>
            <p>
              With a few other fixes, I delivered the website to my client, took
              their feedback, revised once again, and resulted in the final
              version.
