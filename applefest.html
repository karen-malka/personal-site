            This website was made to advertise the Apple Harvest Festival for
            2023. It contains all the information needed before attending the
            festival!

              I conducted user interviews to answer the following question:
              <em
                >What are people looking for when planning to attend the Apple
                Harvest Festival?</em

              or in other words, what are their <em>goals</em>?

                learn how to have an enjoyable out-of-the-house experience

            <h3>Wide Layout ‚û°Ô∏è</h3>
            <p>
              The prototype began with only a wide layout of the website. This
              was important, as to ensure the proper content was placed in the
              website to meet the user's goals.

            <h3>Reactivity</h3>
            <p>
              I then used media queries to add reactivity for the website to
              look nice on narrow screens. Much of the content that was
              initially in flex rows became flex columns (content was stacked).

            <h3>Usability Tests</h3>
            <p>
              I gave tasks for a user to complete and observed their behavior.
              Results revealed a few parts that needed to be adjusted. Notes of
              testing adhered to the following format:
            </p>
            <img
              src="images/usability-testing2.png"
              alt="Usability Testing Table"
              class="code"
            />
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Reflect and Revise</h3>
            <p>
              Usability testing revealed that some of the maps were hard to
              read. So, I added the ability to open the map on a larger screen
              in a new window.
            </p>
            <p>
              With a few other fixes, I delivered the website to my client, took
              their feedback, revised once again, and resulted in the final
              version.
