          <p>
            This website was made to provide users with a way to discover
            different types of art materials that would most appropriately fit
            their desired art project.
          </p>
          <p>
            Users type a query into the information retrieval system such as:
          </p>
          <ul class="design-list">
            <li>
              I want to paint a landscape using blue and green watercolors,
              cheap
            </li>
            <li>I need high quality colored pencils and markers</li>
            <li>I want to bead a bracelet for my best friend</li>
            <li>
              I want to create a drawing with fountain pens but I only have $5
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The IR system pulls the the art material data from Blick, an art
            site, and it determines its recommendations based on word matching
            with the query (using a technique called cosine similarity), a text
            mining aspect (specifically SVD) for interpretability, and product
            reviews.

              I conducted user interviews to answer the following question:

                effectively for users?</em

              This is when I finally wrote the code with working functionality.
              I also altered some designs as I went to create a more cohesive
              looking project.
            </p>
            <p>Here's an example of a change that I made:</p>
            <div class="two-versions">
              <div>
                <img src="images/version1.png" alt="" />

              <div>
                <img src="images/version2.png" alt="" />
                <p>version 2</p>

            <h3>Usability Tests</h3>
            <p>
              I gave tasks for a user to complete and observed their behavior.
              Results revealed a few parts that needed to be adjusted. Notes of
              testing adhered to the following format:
            </p>
            <img
              src="images/usability-testing.png"
              alt="Usability Testing Table"
              class="code"
            />
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Reflect and Revise</h3>
            <p>
              Usability testing revealed an issue with the quotations on the
              Family Engagement page.
            </p>
            <p>
              Initially, on the Family Engagement page, there was a sidebar of
              quotations. However, it seemed too cluttered and was not very
              usable. Thus, I created a carousel of quotes to put at the bottom
              of the page.
            </p>
            <p>
              With a few other fixes, I delivered the website to my client, took
              their feedback, revised once again, and resulted in the final
              version.
